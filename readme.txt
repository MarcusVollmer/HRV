# HRVTool v1.06
## Methods for analyzing Heart Rate Variability

The present functions are originally made for Matlab R2016b. Errors may occur using older releases (at least R2014b required). Additional toolboxes are not required to run the basic analysis. 
The Image Processing Toolbox is recommended and required to use the 'picker'-functionality.
Importing ECGs out of PDFs requires Matlab start as administrator and the installation of Inkscape (or for Linux: PDFminer and pdf2svg).

**HRV.m** is a Matlab class containing function for analyzing HRV.
**HRVTool.m** contains the code to start the GUI (Graphical User Interface) on Matlab.
**HRVTool.mlappinstall** is the app package which can be installed with Matlab.

Please run HRVTool.m to start the GUI or click on the icon in the App menu of Matlab.
The user interface has been tested on Windows 10, Linux Ubuntu 18.04 and Mac OS 10.15.6.
